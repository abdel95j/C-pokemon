Hello ! And welcome to c-pokemon !

Here are the main instructions to play the game we made but we'll try to not be too precise to let you discover the game by yourself.

Basically, this game is pokemon. All the mechanics of our game were inspired by pokemon so you'll find CT (capsule technique) to learn techniques to your pokemons, potions to heal them, candys to make them level up etc... 
If you were used to play pokemon in your youth you'll feel just like it's a back to basics.

For the technical aspect you'll need to have a terminal which can at least display 63x236 characters (63 lines and 236 columns).

To play the game with its musics you'll have to get vlc media player commands by typing "sudo apt_get install vlc" in your terminal.

During the entire game, when having to make a choice or do something you'll have the possibility to go back with the 'spacebar'. The spacebar will allow you to go back in your choices at most of the times, just like a 'B' or 'O' button.

The mooving controls are 'z' and 'UP_ARROW' to moove forward, 's' and 'DOWN_ARROW' to moove backward, 'd' and 'RIGHT_ARROW' to go to the right, 'q' and 'LEFT_ARROW' to go to the left.
The game controls are 'i' to open the inventory (NOT EVERYWHERE) and 'm' to open the menu (NOT EVERYWHERE). While in the menu and inventory you can interact with objects and pokemons (NOT ALL). The last game control is the interact button which is 'e' or 'ENTER_KEY', which will allow you to accept, interact, choose, etc...
There is an exception in the road to go to the league, after picking up a flower by pressing 'e'/'ENTER_KEY' while being on it, you can plant it again on the ground by pressing the 'p' touch.


At the very begining of the game, you'll have the choice between the 3 starters charmander (salam√®che), squirtle (carapuce) and bulbasaur (bulbizarre), and you'll be leaved alone in the town of Bourgpalette. At this point you are free to do anything you want to but you'll be blocked by some obstacles, try to interract with them.

In the map, you'll find your home, in which is your mom that will be helpfull in your adventure.
You'll find other unvisitable batiments, a shop and a lab. We let you discover what's in these buildings. You can enter in by pressing the interact button next to the door.

As in pokemon, the main goal is to become the master of the league ! And, for this you can go fight wild pokemons and try to catch them to make the most powerfull team to fight the masters of the league Blue, Red and Yellow with their own caracters and difficulty !
